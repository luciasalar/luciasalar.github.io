        <h1>Exploring Chinese Political Elite Database (CPED)</h1>
    <p>Recently JunYan Jiang published a Chinese Political Elite Database (CPED), which contains demographic and career information of Chinese political leaders from multiple levels. For more information regarding the dataset, visit: <a href="https://www.junyanjiang.com/data.html">https://www.junyanjiang.com/data.html</a>. For the full code, visit: <a href="https://github.com/luciasalar/government_officials.git">https://github.com/luciasalar/government_officials.git</a></p>

    <h2>Dataset information</h2>
    <p>The CPED includes various details such as name, gender, ethnicity, birthday, birthplace, education back ground, whether the person join the army, whether the person has been expelled from the Communist Party of China(CPC), current position, whether the person commits a crime, when does the person join CPC, how long does the person work in the government, when and where does the person been relocated, job grade, name of the position and so on.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2> 
    <p>Before any learning, some steps were done to process the dataset:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Convert categorical variables to dummy variables.</li>
     <li>Extend some variables based on the existing variables on the dataset.</li>
     <li>Recode the location of where they worked.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cluster Analysis</h2> 
    <p>In order to know what variables can predict the highest position of a government official, a cluster analysis on the variables was conducted. The used method was a model based clustering which has an advantage of adaptable to Gaussian with non-spherical variance.</p>

    <p>After several attempts, it was found that all the extended variables generated and the job grade produced 9 clusters. Adding other variables, especially the location, only confounds the cluster results.</p>

<p>The above table shows all the variables I used in clustering, freq = frequency, nat_ins_relo = relocated by national institute, central_relo = relocated by central government, gov_working_yrs: number of years working in the government, join_cpc: number of years they join CPC; join_cpc_age : age when they join CPC; central_freq : number of times they worked in the central government; freq_change_pos_nor: frequency of being relocated normalized by the number of years they work in the government; central_freq_perce: number of times working in the central government divided by the number of times being relocated. </p>


<p>It's hectic work to see what information contained in these groups manually, so I wrote a function to see which cluster has the highest mean score in each variable. We can see that there are a few clusters that are quite important, group 2 contains most national leaders. Let's call it 'the leader group; group 3 has most directors let's call it 'director group', group 4 has most deputy directors and deputy department heads, department heads, lower than department head positions, let's call this group 'department heads'; group 5 contains officials without rankings, let's call it 'no ranking'. group 6 is the 'ministers' group, group 8 contains people who works in the central government most number of times. We can also see that officials in the leader group have highest mean age.  Group 1 contains least high level government officials, officials in group 9 work in the government shortest period of time. Now we know that unsupervised learning managed to learn some patterns in these variables.
Now let's do a regression and see if these variables can predict the job grade. We selected the highest job grade of each official as the job grade label. We can see that all the variables we selected are significant in the prediction.
lm(formula = job_grade ~ ., data = reg_fea)</p>

Ok, the final part is machine learning. Here I produce a very very basic svm model with R. I'll do a proper ML with Python on a lazy weekend. The basic model turns our really not bad! First, I recode the job grade to binary, with anyone under the minister level as 0, ministers and national leaders are 1. We get a balanced set of data.
